"IN A COZY LITTLE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF A BUSTLING CITY LIVED A SMALL, CURIOUS CAT NAMED WHISKERS. WHISKERS WAS A FLUFFY, ORANGE TABBY WITH BRIGHT GREEN EYES AND A TAIL THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE TWITCHING WITH EXCITEMENT. HE LOVED HIS HOME AND HIS KIND OWNER, MRS. THOMPSON, BUT WHISKERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THE BIG CITY HE COULD SEE FROM HIS WINDOW. ONE SUNNY MORNING, WHILE MRS. THOMPSON WAS TENDING TO HER GARDEN, WHISKERS SAW AN OPPORTUNITY. THE GATE TO THE BACKYARD HAD BEEN LEFT SLIGHTLY OPEN. WITH A MIX OF EXCITEMENT AND A BIT OF NERVOUSNESS, WHISKERS SLIPPED THROUGH THE GAP AND SET OFF ON HIS GRAND ADVENTURE. THE MOMENT WHISKERS STEPPED ONTO THE SIDEWALK, HE WAS AMAZED BY THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS AROUND HIM. TALL BUILDINGS TOWERED ABOVE, AND PEOPLE HURRIED BY, SOME CHATTING ON THEIR PHONES, OTHERS SIPPING COFFEE. CARS ZOOMED PAST, AND THE CITY SEEMED TO BUZZ WITH ENERGY. WHISKERS FELT A BIT OVERWHELMED, BUT HIS CURIOSITY PUSHED HIM FORWARD. AS HE WANDERED, WHISKERS ENCOUNTERED A FRIENDLY PIGEON NAMED PERCY. PERCY WAS PECKING AT CRUMBS ON THE SIDEWALK AND NOTICED THE LITTLE CAT LOOKING AROUND IN AWE. HELLO THERE, PERCY COOED. YOU LOOK NEW AROUND HERE. I'M PERCY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"
